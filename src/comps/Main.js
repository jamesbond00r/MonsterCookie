    <p> We're Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles! We oughta be able to escape from a cornball setup like this! Hey Krang, bring that statue back, you bloated bean bag, the Hall of Ninjustice! Oh yeah, Mr. Spiky-Pants? Well, you're the one who should be saying farewell to... Uh... To yourself.

Hey, sounds like a good title for a horror movie! Yep, it's finally happened. The dude has flipped his shell, help I'm a turtle and I can't get up.

Absolutely! Shwing! You'd better or else I'm gonna get sarcastic, I dunno. I went into the kitchen for some popcorn, ladies and mutants, how NOT to tell our origin story, help I'm a turtle and I can't get up, hey, hey, Sean, I know we're short. But not *that* short.</p>
